                                               Overview 
These are the various projects I've worked on which include data analysis and visualization on methane emissions, storms, Airbnb, and monthly insurance premiums. Completed the data analysis and visualization by extracting, transforming, loading, and visualizing data using software including Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, which allowed me to identify key insights and trends, and calculate the mean, median, and quartile ranges. In addition, machine learning projects.

#Data Analysis

##Covid - 19 Data Analysis & Dashboard -  Identified covid-19 transmission rates and the average vaccination rates per region and country, using SQL and Tableau.

###Methane Emissions Data Analysis & Dashboard - Quantified methane emissions by region, country, and segment, and then results were visualized on the       Tableau dashboard.

####Storms Data Analysis & Dashboard  - Transformed data using Excel and Pandas, and the results were visualized on the Tableau dashboard.

#Machine Learning

##Predictive Analysis - Determined if company should focus on their application or their website, using a linear regression model. In addition, predicted the yearly amount spent by using a linear regression model. The evaluation of the model was evaluated with the MAE, MSE, RMSE, and the Explained Variance Score.

                              Skills Used: Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau
#Excel - Used Power Query to extract, transform, and load data to the workbook, and also added Pivot Tables to group the data by columns. In addition, used Conditional Formatting to identify patterns and trends in the table.

##Python - Used Python libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to transform and plot data. In addition, used Python libraries Scikit-learn for machine learning.

###SQL - Used SQL to extract, transform, and load data onto the database. Additionally, used SQL queries to calculate the mean, median, and quartile ranges in a dataset.

####Tableau - Used Tableau to visualize data by importing data from Excel, Python, and SQL.
