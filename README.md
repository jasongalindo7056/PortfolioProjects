Overview 
    
    These are the various projects I've worked on which include data analysis and visualization on methane emissions, 
    storms, Airbnb, and monthly insurance premiums. Completed data analysis and visualization by extracting, transfor
    ming, loading, and visualizing data using software including Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, which allowed me to 
    identify key insights and trends, and calculate the mean, median, and quartile ranges.

    #Methane Emissions Data Analysis & Dashboard - Quantified methane emissions by region, country, and segment, and then results were visualized on the       Tableau dashboard.

    ##Storms Data Analysis & Dashboard  - Transformed data using Excel and Pandas, and the results were visualized on the Tableau dashboard.


Skills Used: Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau

#Excel - Used Power Query to extract, transform, and load data to the workbook, and also added Pivot Tables to group the data by columns. In addition, used Conditional Formatting to identify patterns and trends in the table.

##Python - Used Python libraries including Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to transform and plot data.

###SQL - Used SQL to extract, transform, and load data onto the database. Additionally, used SQL queries to calculate the mean, median, and quartile ranges in a dataset.

####Tableau - Used Tableau to visualize data by importing data from Excel, Python, and SQL.
